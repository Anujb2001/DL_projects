Whether it's a chain of quick serve restaurants (QSRs), fast casual, or a more conventional sit-down establishment,
today's restaurant business is dramatically different from years past.
The industry as a whole has grown tremendously, as consumers are spending nearly $2 billion more at bars and
restaurants each year than they are on groceries. This industry first is driven largely by more diverse food choices,
an influx of food ordering and reservation technologies, and consumers' growing preferences for dining out with
family and friends than for cooking and cleaning at home.
But today’s restaurant leaders--CEOs, CMOs, franchisors, and other executives--face a litany of challenges such as
an increasing number and types of competitors, evolving consumer preferences, growing and exceedingly
complex supply chains, and complex internal business operations that make capitalizing on that trend more
difficult than it seems.
To gain a sustainable competitive advantage, enterprising restaurant leaders are turning to integrated analytics
solutions for deep, real-time insights into all aspects of their business. Armed with comprehensive and end-to-end
information about sales, food costs, and other aspects of business operations, they can achieve greater
responsiveness, business agility, and strategic decision making.
This guide will help you better understand which reports and tools to use for creating a 360- degree view of your
business and how to transform them into high-value customer insights that improve the customer experience,
boost revenues, and increase profitability.

Introduction
Introduction 1
Consumers in the digital age are more informed and savvier than ever. They have easy, reliable anytime access to
information like online restaurant reviews, menus, and even table availability that gives them unprecedented
purchasing power-- while also leaving behind a trail of rich, personal information never previously available.
Yet, as consumer buying behaviors have continued to evolve, the way restaurants evaluate their successes and
failures have not. Many businesses still rely on simple historical transaction data from their Point of Sale (PoS)
systems as the foundation for making decisions instead of leveraging other, more robust information.
Transaction reports are helpful for identifying high-level trends, but emphasize just one aspect of a restaurant’s
operations that results in visibility gaps that make it difficult to:
● Accurately predict sales ● Manage inventory efficiently
● Reduce food waste and food costs ● Increase employee productivity
● Improve customer retention ● Identify underperforming locations
Other systems for managing inventory, loss prevention, and other operations can provide additional sources of
data. But since these systems are often not integrated, extracting and analyzing the information often requires
more time and resources than restaurants have available.
As a result, information remains unused in silos, leaving restaurant executives to wonder why food waste
continues to average approximately 10% of the total amount of purchased food 3, employee churn rates exceed
72% 4 , how specific menu items will sell, and how to accurately compare store-to- store performance.

Essential Restaurant Ops Insights
Running a restaurant is hard work. It’s even harder when you’re operating it with incomplete information.
Restaurant executives seeking more efficient operations, lower costs, and greater profitability can benefit from
integrated analytics platforms.
Standalone systems for managing inventory, employee hours and payroll, or other operations typically require
unique logins and constant toggling among different reports. By contrast, full-service analytics solutions
seamlessly integrate with PoS, human resources, inventory management, and other systems to deliver as many as
15 unique reports, on demand.
Here are the most critical sales operations and customer experience insights you’ll need for 360-degree visibility
and actionable intelligence from every facet of your operation to make smarter business decisions, faster.

Essential Restaurant Ops Insights 13
In an industry as dynamic and unpredictable as food service, restaurant leaders need to arm themselves with as
much information as possible.
Deploying an integrated analytics solution—whether cloud-based or on-premises—gives restaurant leaders
visibility across their organization and the information they need to maximize efficiency, the customer experience,
and profitability.
Advantages of Analytics Platforms
Real-time access to data from across operations
Maximize employee productivity, improve customer retention, and optimize loss prevention to boost margins
Faster, more strategic decision making
Leverage real-time reporting to proactively address evolving consumer tastes and preferences, uncover and
capitalize on emerging trends and be first to market, and attack performance issues before they become a real
problem
Greater efficiency and cost management
Improve inventory management and sales forecasting to reduce food waste, eliminate data silos and toggling
among various systems, and achieve faster time to insight with intuitive, customizable reports
Restaurant analytics in action
Over the last several years, high-profile brands such as Wendy’s, Domino’s Pizza, and Darden Restaurants have
embraced data analytics to better understand the strengths and weakness of their businesses in ways they
previously couldn’t and transform those insights into business success.
For example, Wendy’s has taken advantage of location intelligence solutions to improve ad targeting and new
location selections. The company’s marketing and advertising team uses the tool to improve ad targeting, develop
new menu items, and assess the success of their efforts. At the same time, the company’s real estate department
can analyze massive amounts of information to determine the best possible location for each new restaurant. In
just two years, the company estimates that it’s saved more than $750,000 in wasted expenses from poor location
selection alone 6 .
Chapter 13
Intelligence is Power
Intelligence is Power 14
Darden Restaurants and Domino’s Pizza have had similar successes in leveraging historical and predictive
analytics to benefit their businesses. Darden, for example, uses real-time sales figures in each location to power
The Kitchen Display System, which tells cooks what to prepare and when to deliver each item for maximum
efficiency and to enhance the customer experience7. Meanwhile, Domino’s AnyWare system captures data
through channels like text message, Twitter, and Amazon Echo, which is with geocode, demographic, and
competitor data to allow in depth customer segmentation for targeted promotions and messaging8 .
How popular restaurant chains use data analytics
Wendy’s: location intelligence to select new store locations, create geo-specific menu
items, and promotions. Saved approximately $750,000 in expenses over two years.
Darden Restaurants: uses PoS transactional data to power The Kitchen Display
System, which tells cooks what to prepare and when to deliver it for greater efficiency,
less waste, and improved customer experience
Domino’s Pizza: combines in-store and third-party data from every channel to
efficiently segment customer groups for targeted promotions and advertising.

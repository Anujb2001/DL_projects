The Restaurant - (ff, teen, first time)
By Mel (an506271@anon.penet.fi)

UNUSUAL FRANK ADMISSION-BABBLE:
Ok.  So, to tell the truth, this isn't a repost by request.
I figure I've written enough of these to be like a super-
star and re-release an old work without anyone complaining.
Many of you have written to me to tell me how much you
liked this story, and it's one of my favourites, too.  The
fact that it's true makes it all the more exciting.  Please
note that due to unforseeable arseholes, I've had to change
my anon address.  My new one is up the top there.  My life
has suddenly got very busy lately, so I'm not writing as
much as I could.  When I get the time, I'll write some more
about my times with Sian.  In the meantime, if there's a
style or type of story you'd like to hear about, drop me a
line, and I'll write one for you personally.  Thanks again
to all those who have sent me their kind words.  Your
thoughts were very generous.  Oh, and one last thing, I've
really gotten into IRC lately, and I'm often hanging around
there looking for people to chat to, so if you'd like to
talk to me there, send me an email with your usual nick-
name, and I'll keep an eye out for you when I'm on.  This
was a terribly long paragraph, I know, so thank you to those who
managed to stay awake right until this last sentence.

USUAL PLEAD-FOR-EMAIL BABBLE:
All mail is greatly welcomed, and will be answered promptly.  If
you like this, let me know.  If you hate it, let me know, too. 
If you didn't bother to read it, rack off.  In case you haven't
realised, I *love* email.  So write to me!

USUAL AUTHOR-BLOWS-HER-OWN-TRUMPET BABBLE:
If I keep this up, I may have to change careers!  Keep those
messages coming (every pun intended).  The more you write, the
more I'll write.  If anyone has any requests, send those along,
too.  And this is the bit where I write something quite profound.
 This time it has to do with a country which considers itself to
be #1, and how it has all these wonderful freedoms and
privileges, and yet it votes in a government which passes a silly
unworkable law which attempts to censor its own citizens with a
blanket ban.  I'm not going to name that country, because most of
my readers come from there, but I will say that I'm bloody proud
to be a New Zealander, and I have yet to see a country that is a
more wonderful place to live than right here.  We are a beautiful
nation, with wonderful people. If you get the chance, come and
check out my edge of the planet. We don't have governments that
pass silly laws, and we have gorgeous scenery, breathtaking
views, warm and friendly people, and quite a few warm and
friendly sheep, too. &lt;grin&gt;  I have never heard of anyone who has
left New Zealand disappointed. New Zealand is Godzone.  I love my
country.



               I dedicate this story to you.

This is another one of those tell-all stories that Americans are
so famous for.  But seeing as I'm not American, perhaps their
culture is invading ours?  Hmm, could be a psychological thing
there, but I'm not about to examine it, and that's not what
you're here for, is it?  No, you're here to read about the first
time I made wonderful love with a woman, and started my road to
bisexuality (which, incidentally, does not have a hyphen, no
matter what anyone tells you)  It is a very personal story for
me, and is also rather romantic.  I hope you enjoy it.

Her name was Sian, and we shared one of the most wonderfully
romantic times in my life - and I didn't even know I was
attracted to her.  I didn't know what it was at first, but there
was definitely something there.  But here I go again, starting a
story in the middle.  I digress too much, I'm told.  I prefer to
call it 'adding flavour'.  Anyway, as I said, her name was Sian. 
You can pronounce that however the hell you like, but she just
pronounced it like "Shawn".  I'd always though "Zhianne" would be
more exotic, but, no, she preferred "Shawn".

We were at a dinner party at one of those terribly bothersome
end-of-year celebrations.  You know, where everyone all over the
city invites their friends and colleagues out to dinner on the
same evening, when they've only shared two words with you all
year.  Fortunately, this was rather more relaxed than others I
had turned down.  The restaurant was a delightful one, situated
on the edge of a beautiful riverbank, out of the way of the
hustle of the city.  While there were many eating inside, some
were dining al fresco, and others were standing around the
balcony watching the sun explode into fiery colours before it set
below the hills.  I was one of those outside - there were three
of us, in fact.  Myself, Sian and Belinda.  We three had known
each other for most of the year, and we all got on rather well. 
I had known Belinda rather more than Sian, but by the time the
night was out, all that changed!  I think I was about 16 at the
time, and she was a few months younger than I.  It's important to
understand that up until this time, I had been totally
heterosexual.  All that I had been interested in were guys, and
the thought of being involved with a girl had never even crossed
my mind.  I knew, of course, that there were girls who liked
other girls, but I'd never actually *met* one.

So there we were, leaning over the railing, off to the side of
the building.  We were talking about this and that (as girls tend
to do), and I don't know how it came up, but Sian admitted that
she was a lesbian.  Of course, I didn't believe her for an
instant.  Everyone knew that lesbians had horns growing out of
their head and were either nuns or schoolteachers.  Sian was none
of these.  I'm usually kind of a daring person, so I said "You're
not a lesbian!" and gave her a quick little kiss on the lips. 
Sian was so shocked that she jump backwards with a start.  "There
- you see?" I said to Belinda, "She's not a lesbian!"  We all had
a giggle over that, and the talk turned to other topics, and I
never thought more of it after that.

Soon I was dragged off by someone to meet someone's boss, and
Sian and Belinda re-grouped elsewhere.  After I had promised
someone's boss that I'd do some-or-other sometime soon, I went
off looking for Sian and Belinda.  I noticed Sian sitting on the
riverbank, staring out at the ducks taking a swim.  I wandered
over and sat down beside her.  We talked about this and that,
about life and the future, then we started getting chilly, so we
decided to head back inside.  Sian noticed that I'd got a few
leaves on my dress, so she carefully dusted me off.  I remember
thinking that she was being *very* particular about dusting me
off, and taking her time about it.  I couldn't understand why,
but I started getting very excited, and felt myself moisten. 
Then she turned her bottom to me, and offered it for
brushing-off.  I complied, also taking as much special attention
as she did.  Having cleaned up, we sauntered back inside.

We were soon split up again, and dragged into more boring 
conversations with people we'd really rather not meet.  About an
hour later, I met up with her again when she came across to my
table.  She suggested, since it was such a fine night, that we
take a walk down to the river.  I was feeling quite warm, so I
readily agreed.  On the way down there, the path got quite
narrow, so I took her hand (or did she offer it?) to steady her
as she walked in front of me.  When we got to the bottom of the
path, we were still holding hands, which it seemed entirely
natural - just two friends enjoying each other's company.

There was a jetty about 100 metres down from the bottom of the
path, so we walked towards that, and sat on the end of it.  The
jetty was quite short - about 6 metres - and was made of a few
planks nailed together, and stretched a little way over the
river.  As we sat together, watching the water flow rapidly under
us, we were completely out in the open - particularly under the
bright moonlight - but it seemed as though we were the only two
people in the entire world.

We sat there, mesmerised by the water running beneath us, 
and watched it in silence.  Several minutes had passed, and Sian
asked me what I was thinking.  "Nothing," I replied honestly,
since I was quite taken by this beautiful night.  Then she began
to talk softly about strangers and how they might be different,
and about how she found it difficult to tell someone what she was
feeling, for fear of rejection.  She also told me that she felt
really good when I had dusted her off before, and that it made
her feel all warm inside.  I can't really say at what point I
realised what I was actually getting myself into.  It all flowed,
like the river, rather naturally.  I guess at this stage I had a
fair idea what was happening, but I really just wanted things to
happen slowly.

Sian talked to me more about feelings, and wanting to say 
things to people, but being afraid.  Then, out of the blue and
without thinking about it, I turned to her, stared into her
beautiful blue eyes, and said, very gently:  "Kiss me."

I'm not sure why I said that, but it completely freaked me out
when I heard those words coming from my lips.  This was a *woman*
that I was talking to, not some guy from school!  Before I could
even think about the consequences though, she reached over,
placed her hands on my shoulders, and pulled me closer to her. 
She tilted her head, and placed her rich, soft lips on mine.  I
was trembling so much, I couldn't control myself.  I wasn't sure
whether I was trembling from excitement, or from cold, but I was
loving every moment.  I felt a tingle course through my body as
she kissed me passionately, slipping her tongue between my lips,
and probing inside me.  I was so turned on, I couldn't believe
it!  This woman was doing things to me that no man ever had.  I
returned her kiss firmly, sliding my tongue over hers, and into
her mouth, feeling not only her mouth, but her very soul.

She reached behind me and unzipped my black dress, letting it
fall around me, and then, with a practiced touch, slipped my bra
down, too.  Her hands roved over my flesh, massaging my breasts
in small circles.  I shivered, and again I wasn't sure whether it
was from cold, or from pleasure.  Her hands were making magic as
they probed across my body, and I moaned gently into her mouth.

Sian broke contact, reluctantly, and undid her blouse, loosened
her bra, and removed her jeans and underpants, all in one swift,
fluid motion.  Then she returned to me, kissing me again with
such force that my breath was taken away.  Her hands came back to
their comfortable position over my breasts, and her touch felt so
right, so natural, that I couldn't believe I hadn't missed it
before.  Cautiously I brought my right hand to her breast,
beneath her bra and rubbed it firmly like I had often done to
myself alone at nights.  The instant I contacted with her skin,
Sian squirmed with delight and kissed me harder and more
forcefully than she had before.  This was such a rush!  I was so
turned on at the feel of this woman that I rubbed her breasts
harder, with more vigour, tracing tiny circles around her
nipples.  Her hands were running all over my body now, across my
breasts and up and down my back.  Still kissing me, she raised us
up together to a kneeling position, and slid my dress down my
knees, and off my body.  We returned to a sitting position,
surrounded by clothes, and basking our mostly-naked bodies in the
glistening moonlight.

Sian broke contact with our lips, and slid her middle finger into
her mouth with a deliciously sly grin, then moved her hand down
my body, down to my now-wet pussy.  She lay me back on the jetty,
resting my body comfortably on our clothes, and massaged the flat
of her hand across my genitals, gently surrounding my clitoris
with her strokes.  As she did this, she slipped her wet finger
delicately inside me.  It slid in easily, assisted by my ravaging
juices.  She lowered her lips to my breasts, kissing them,
sucking them, teasing them as she plunged her finger in and out
of my vagina, faster and faster.  I moaned loudly, surprised at
the intensity of my voice, and reached down to stroke her face
and run my fingers through her beautiful blonde hair.  She paused
to look up at me with a smile, and planted a wonderful,
tantalising kiss on my lips before returning to my breasts.  I
groaned under her touch, and bucked my hips up at her
involuntarily.

With a swift motion, Sian flipped her body around so that her
head was resting in my crotch, then slowly lowered her hips over
my face.  I couldn't believe it!  There was actually a woman's
hairy pussy resting over my face!  Sian reached down and pulled
my lips apart, sucking sweetly on my clitoris, then moving her
head down and slipping her wonderful tongue inside me!  I moaned
loudly again, and shivered uncontrollably.  'Fuck!' I thought to
myself.  'I can't believe I'm actually going to eat my first
pussy!'  With shaking hands, I held her legs firmly, and ran my
tongue along the length of her labia, pausing on her clitoris,
then throwing abandon to the wind and sucking on it, nibbling it,
licking it.  Sian squirmed above me, and thrust her hips down on
me, forcing my tongue inside her.  She tasted so delicious!  Like
sweet honey!  So alive, so vibrant.  I shoved my tongue deeper
into her, fucking her, and loving every moment of it.  I was
getting so worked up over her ministrations down at my crotch
that I wriggled under her, thrusting my hips up at her, panting
uncontrollably.  I felt a familiar feeling rise through my body,
and a massive orgasm swept through me as we fucked each other
with our tongues.  She slipped a finger inside my anus as I came,
increasing the tension, throwing me headlong into a second orgasm
soon after.  I followed her lead, and slipped my finger into her
ass also.  She seem to love this, because her pussy was now
fucking my tongue, rather than the other way round.  We both
moaned frantically as we continued this for another 20 minutes,
celebrating with several more orgasms together before she slid
off me, panting and gasping for breath.  I pulled her to me,
holding her, cherishing her body.  She lay on top of me and we
gently stroked each other's bodies, cooing softly, and revering
our lovemaking under the stars.

Soon it began to get chilly, and my shivering was now 
definitely from cold, so we dressed reluctantly, and slowly made
our way up the hill to the restaurant.  We held each other's
hand, sharing no words, but relishing our thoughts.  We had
bonded, as only two women can, and that bond would hold us
together for years to come.  As we got to the restaurant, we
hesitantly dropped hands, walking only side by side.  Belinda was
there, waiting for us by the balcony.  "Where have you two been?"
she asked of us.  "Enjoying the moonlight?"  Our bodies must have
reeked of our love juices, but if Belinda noticed, she didn't say
anything.  Instead, Sian and I smiled at each other, and the
three of us headed to the bar for a cocktail.
